SNOWBALL FIGHT!

video

screenshots

Shoot snowballs at people to turn them into snowmen, so Mr Snowman isn't lonely anymore!
Use WASD to move, mouse to aim, and left click to shoot. 

The game detects player input for movement and shooting. The NPCs detect the players location and move towards them.
Once an NPC is hit with a snowball, they turn into a snowman and are no longer hostile to the player.
